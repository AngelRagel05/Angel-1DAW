                <i>New York, 5 July 2023</i> - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the 
                Sustainable Development Goals <b>(SDGs)</b>, the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ahead 
                of a critical <b>UN</b> Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase 
                the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda 
                for our common future.
            </p>

            <p>
                At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the <b>SDGs</b> is in peril. For the first time in decades, development 
                progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 2023 <b>SDG</b> Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their 
                collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the 
                world back on track to achieving the <b>SDGs</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the <b>UN</b> campaign aims to 
                re-energize the conversation about the Goals.

                    "We want to get everyone on board for the <b>SDGs</b>"". "Our hope is that decisionmakers and individual citizens alike will feel 
                    inspired to join the conversation and contribute to achieving the Goals with new resolve and ambition".

            <p>
                Building off the color wheel brand of the <b>SDGs</b>, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its 
                messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the <b>SDGs</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the <b>SDGs</b> through the <b>UN</b>â€™s ActNow initiative 
                across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform 
                lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the <b>SDGs</b> and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
            </p>

            <p>
                A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment, sports and beyond, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their 
                social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80 million globally to take individual action on the <b>SDGs</b> and to impress 
                upon decisionmakers the urgency to act now.
